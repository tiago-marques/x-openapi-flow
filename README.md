# x-openapi-flow

`x-openapi-flow` is an OpenAPI vendor extension and CLI for documenting and validating resource lifecycle workflows.

It adds explicit state-machine metadata (`x-openapi-flow`) to operations and validates both schema and lifecycle graph consistency.

## Why It Exists

Most teams document endpoints but not lifecycle behavior. State transitions become implicit, inconsistent, and hard to validate in CI.

## Quick Start

From your API project root:

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow init
npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml
```

That is the default adoption path.

For a full rollout guide (local + CI + PR checks), see `docs/wiki/Adoption-Playbook.md`.
For common errors and fixes, see `docs/wiki/Troubleshooting.md`.

## Initialization Behavior

Running `init`:

- Auto-detects OpenAPI source files (`openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`, `swagger.yaml`, etc.)
- Creates or syncs `{context}.x.(json|yaml)` (sidecar with lifecycle metadata)
- Generates `{context}.flow.(json|yaml)` automatically when missing
- If `{context}.flow.(json|yaml)` already exists, asks for confirmation in interactive mode and creates `{context}.x.(json|yaml).backup-N`
- In non-interactive mode, fails when `{context}.flow.(json|yaml)` already exists unless `--force` is provided

File roles:

- Source of truth for API shape: your generated OpenAPI source file (`openapi.yaml`)
- Source of truth for lifecycle metadata: `{context}.x.(json|yaml)`
- CLI/config: `x-openapi-flow.config.json` (optional)

Recommended update loop:

1. Regenerate/update your OpenAPI source file with your framework tool.
2. Run `npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml` to inject sidecar lifecycle data.

Optional quality gate:

- Run `npx x-openapi-flow validate openapi.yaml --profile strict`.

## Quickstart (Local Development)

```bash
cd flow-spec
npm install
node bin/x-openapi-flow.js validate examples/order-api.yaml
```

## Repository Structure

- `flow-spec/schema/flow-schema.json`: extension JSON Schema contract.
- `flow-spec/lib/validator.js`: validation engine (schema + graph consistency).
- `flow-spec/bin/x-openapi-flow.js`: validation CLI.
- `flow-spec/examples/*.yaml`: OpenAPI examples with `x-openapi-flow`.
- `.github/workflows/x-openapi-flow-validate.yml`: CI validation workflow example.

## Extension Contract

`x-openapi-flow` allows documenting, per operation, the current lifecycle state (`current_state`) and allowed transitions (`transitions`) with explicit triggers.

### Minimum Required Fields

Each `x-openapi-flow` block must include:

- `version`: extension contract version (`"1.0"`)
- `id`: unique identifier of the flow step
- `current_state`: state represented by the operation

### Optional Transition Guidance

Optional transition guidance fields:

- `next_operation_id`: operationId typically called for the next transition
- `prerequisite_operation_ids`: operationIds expected before a transition
- `prerequisite_field_refs`: required field references before a transition
- `propagated_field_refs`: field references reused in downstream flows

### Field Reference Format

Field reference format:

- `operationId:request.body.field`
- `operationId:request.path.paramName`
- `operationId:response.<status>.body.field` (example: `createPayment:response.201.body.id`)

## Sidecar Structure (full)

The sidecar file generated by `init` has this shape:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
operations:
	- operationId: createOrder
		x-openapi-flow:
			version: "1.0"
			id: create-order
			current_state: CREATED
			description: Creates order and starts lifecycle
			idempotency:
				header: Idempotency-Key
				required: true
			transitions:
				- target_state: PAID
					trigger_type: synchronous
					condition: Payment approved
					next_operation_id: payOrder
					prerequisite_operation_ids:
						- createOrder
					prerequisite_field_refs:
						- createOrder:request.body.customer_id
					propagated_field_refs:
						- createOrder:response.201.body.order_id
```

Supported fields:

- Sidecar document:
	- `version` (optional, default `"1.0"`)
	- `operations` (optional array)
- Operation entry:
	- `operationId` (recommended)
	- `x-openapi-flow` (required to apply)
	- `key` (legacy compatibility fallback)
- `x-openapi-flow`:
	- Required: `version`, `id`, `current_state`
	- Optional: `description`, `idempotency`, `transitions`
- Transition:
	- Required: `target_state`, `trigger_type`
	- Optional: `condition`, `next_operation_id`, `prerequisite_operation_ids`, `prerequisite_field_refs`, `propagated_field_refs`

For package-focused details, see `flow-spec/README.md`.

## Install and Run

Use with npx (recommended):

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow init
```

Run tests locally:

```bash
cd flow-spec
npm install
npm test
```

Optional mirror on GitHub Packages (default usage remains unscoped on npm):

```bash
npm config set @tiago-marques:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
npm install @tiago-marques/x-openapi-flow
```

When authentication is required, add this to your `.npmrc`:

```ini
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN}
```

Use a GitHub PAT with `read:packages` (install) and `write:packages` (publish).

## CLI Reference

### Commands

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow validate <openapi-file> [--format pretty|json] [--profile core|relaxed|strict] [--strict-quality] [--config path]
npx x-openapi-flow init [--flows path] [--force] [--dry-run]
npx x-openapi-flow apply [openapi-file] [--flows path] [--out path]
npx x-openapi-flow diff [openapi-file] [--flows path] [--format pretty|json]
npx x-openapi-flow lint [openapi-file] [--format pretty|json] [--config path]
npx x-openapi-flow graph <openapi-file> [--format mermaid|json]
npx x-openapi-flow doctor [--config path]
```

Canonical command details are maintained in:

- `flow-spec/README.md`
- `docs/wiki/CLI-Reference.md`

Preferred `apply` usage in this repository is sidecar positional:

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml
```

Supported OpenAPI 3 HTTP methods across `init`, `apply`, and `graph`:

- `get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`, `options`, `head`, `patch`, `trace`

### Common Commands

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow validate flow-spec/examples/payment-api.yaml
npx x-openapi-flow init
npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml
npx x-openapi-flow lint openapi.yaml
npx x-openapi-flow graph flow-spec/examples/order-api.yaml
npx x-openapi-flow doctor
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow validate flow-spec/examples/order-api.yaml --profile relaxed
npx x-openapi-flow validate flow-spec/examples/quality-warning-api.yaml --strict-quality
npx x-openapi-flow validate flow-spec/examples/ticket-api.yaml --format json
npx x-openapi-flow init --dry-run
npx x-openapi-flow diff openapi.yaml --format json
npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml --out openapi.flow.yaml
npx x-openapi-flow apply swagger.json --flows examples/swagger.x.json
```

Behavior notes:

- `init` works by auto-discovering an existing OpenAPI source file (run from your OpenAPI project root).
- `init` creates/synchronizes a sidecar file based on OpenAPI context (for example, `swagger.x.json` or `openapi.x.yaml`) to persist `x-openapi-flow` metadata across regenerations.
- If `{context}.flow.(json|yaml)` already exists, `init` asks for confirmation in interactive mode.
- In non-interactive mode, use `init --force` to skip prompt, back up sidecar as `{context}.x.(json|yaml).backup-N`, and recreate `{context}.flow.(json|yaml)`.
- Use `init --dry-run` to preview sidecar/flow changes without writing files.
- Legacy naming (`{context}-openapi-flow.(json|yaml)`) remains compatible in `apply` and `graph`.
- Use `apply` after regenerating your OpenAPI source file to re-inject sidecar metadata (for example: `npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml`).
- If no OpenAPI/Swagger source file exists yet, create one first with your framework's official generator.

## Regeneration Workflow

```bash
# 1) generate/open your OpenAPI source file (framework-specific)

# 2) initialize and sync sidecar
npx x-openapi-flow init

# 3) edit {context}.x.(json|yaml) with your flow states/transitions

# 4) whenever OpenAPI is regenerated, re-apply flows
npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml
```

## Copilot Ready (AI Sidecar Authoring)

The most sensitive part of adoption is usually authoring lifecycle data in the sidecar.
This repository includes an AI authoring guide at `llm.txt` to help assistants populate sidecar files with higher consistency.

Recommended AI-assisted flow:

1. Run `npx x-openapi-flow init`.
2. Ask your AI assistant to fill `{context}.x.(json|yaml)` using `llm.txt`.
3. Run `npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml`.
4. Run `npx x-openapi-flow apply openapi.x.yaml` again after AI updates (if needed).

The `llm.txt` guide covers required fields, transition modeling, field reference formats, and a quality checklist.

Prompt template (copy/paste):

```text
Use llm.txt from this repository as authoring rules.
Read my OpenAPI source file and populate {context}.x.(json|yaml) only.
Do not change endpoint paths or HTTP methods.
Generate x-openapi-flow per operationId with coherent states/transitions,
including next_operation_id, prerequisite_field_refs, and propagated_field_refs when applicable.
Then run: init -> apply -> validate --profile strict.
```

## Validation

### Profiles

- `strict` (default): schema + advanced graph checks as errors; quality as warnings (or errors with `--strict-quality`).
- `relaxed`: schema and orphan checks as errors; advanced/quality checks as warnings.
- `core`: validates only schema and orphan states.

### File-Based Configuration

You can use `x-openapi-flow.config.json` in the current directory (or pass it via `--config`):

```json
{
	"profile": "strict",
	"format": "pretty",
	"strictQuality": false
}
```

Example file: `flow-spec/x-openapi-flow.config.example.json`.

### What Gets Validated

1. **Schema validation**: enforces shape and required fields of `x-openapi-flow`.
2. **Graph validation**: detects orphan `target_state` entries (without matching `current_state` in any operation).
3. **Advanced graph checks**:
	- requires at least one initial state (`indegree = 0`)
	- requires at least one terminal state (`outdegree = 0`)
	- detects unreachable states from initial states
	- detects cycles (flow must be acyclic)
4. **Quality checks**:
	- warns when there are multiple initial states
	- warns about duplicate transitions (`from + to + trigger_type`)
	- warns about states with no path to any terminal state
	- warns about invalid operation and field references in transitions

By default, quality checks produce **warnings**. Use `--strict-quality` to treat them as errors (exit code 1).

## Visualization

### Graph Output

`x-openapi-flow graph` generates Mermaid (or JSON) output for the state flow, helping review between developers and architecture teams.
When transitions include `next_operation_id` and `prerequisite_operation_ids`, Mermaid edges include those values as labels.

Example:

```bash
npx x-openapi-flow graph flow-spec/examples/order-api.yaml
```

### Swagger UI Integration

Current automated tests in this repository use only CLI execution (`node:test`) and do not use Swagger UI, ReDoc, or RapiDoc.

To visualize and interpret `x-openapi-flow` in Swagger UI:

1. Enable vendor extension rendering with `showExtensions: true`.
2. Use the plugin in `flow-spec/lib/swagger-ui/x-openapi-flow-plugin.js`.
3. Open `flow-spec/examples/swagger-ui/index.html` and point it to your OpenAPI source file.

This plugin adds a small operation summary panel showing key `x-openapi-flow` fields like `version` and `current_state`.
It can also render a graph image if `graph_image_url` is present in `x-openapi-flow` (or if `window.XOpenApiFlowGraphImageUrl` is configured).

Example result image:
